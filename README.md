# 20-questions

This is a basic example of the game 20 Questions that I made several years ago, initally in Java and now in C#.

It features two categories: Animals and Instruments. The objective of the program is to "guess" what item you are thinking of from the category of your choosing by asking questions to narrow down the possible results.
